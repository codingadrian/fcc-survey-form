# FreeCodeCamp - Survey Form

This is my 2nd project for the FCC, and it is to practice HTML and CSS

## Motivation for the project

What motivates me, is to become a Full Stack Web Developer.

## Author

My name is Adrian Robles, I am a 32 y. o. Costa Rican self learning to become his dream.

## Goal

To complete this project following the user stories that FCC requires and have it pass all the tests.

## Achievements

I completed the site, but I realized it would have been better it I had done the layout a diff way. It passed all the tests and I felt fine with it and for the amount of knowledge I had.

## Resources

I mostly used [W3 Schools](http://w3schools.com/) to make sure I was using the correct syntax.
